Set up a simple server and client to test out some theories about upgrading from react 16 to 18. It should have this tech stack:

- server
    - node
    - typescript
    - graphql-yoga
- client
    - vite
    - typescript
    - react
    - react-router
    - apollo client for graphql
    - redux

The server should have mock user data.

The client should render up to 10 users at a time in a table. It should use j/k for nav between pages.
